# Puppeteer-Instagram-Scrapper

An instagram scrapping in JavaScript build with puppeteer, that after you give your usename and password, it logs in in your profile takes the number of "followers" and "following" and gets the people from those 2 lists and compares them.

 And it returns you 3 lists bassed on who you follow without them following you back etc.
